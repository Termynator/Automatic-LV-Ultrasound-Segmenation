	abstract="Thanks to the ever-advancing technologies, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a major diagnostic tool in clinical cardiology for acquisition of morphological, functional and metabolic information. However, it is of no doubt that only when complemented with the use of contrast agents, can cardiac MRI fully play its pivotal roles in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making. In particular, MR coronary angiography, perfusion mapping, and cellular membrane integrity or myocardial viability assessment rely more on the use of appropriate contrast agents. The current chapter aims to provide an overview on the main topics related to MRI contrast agents including the mechanisms of MRI contrast and contrast agents, classification of both commercially available and preclinically investigational contrast agents useful for cardiac MRI, as well as the general scope of contrast agent applications in relevant clinical practice and experimental research.",

	abstract = "Ejection fraction (EF) reflects both cardiac function and remodeling, and is widely recognized as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool. Its use in a variety of settings, ranging from heart failure and myocardial infarction to valvular heart disease, has made it a cornerstone of modern cardiology, pervading guidelines and practice. However, the development of the test was in another era, with younger patients and a lower prevalence of heart failure with preserved EF. The performance expectations of EF in the current era are also demanding—in relation to detection of subclinical LV dysfunction, and especially relating to recognition of changes in LV function on sequential testing—for example in patients taking cardiotoxic drugs. This review discusses whether the impressive evidence base for EF justifies its ongoing use in the context of newer markers of LV function, and the sophisticated questions posed by modern cardiology."

Weighted mean normal values for LVEF at rest were 62.3±6.1\\% (1SD) with a lower limit of normal of 50\\% and for RVEF 52.3±6.2\\% (N=365) with a lower limit of normal of 40\\%. During exercise, LVEF increased in 475 subjects by +8.0 EF\\% (range 3–15\\%), a normal increase being accepted to be ≥5\\% over a normal resting value for both LVEF and RVEF. Subgroup analysis of results at rest revealed no significant differences regarding selection of normal subjects (based on normal catheterization findings vs. normal volunteers with low probability of disease), age or sex. During exercise, however, significantly larger increases in LVEF measurements were noted for men versus women (P\\&lt;0.01), for normal volunteers versus subjects selected as ‘normals’ based on a normal coronary angiogram (P\\&lt;0.001) and for younger versus older subjects (P\\&lt;0.001). Data on reproducibility and variability showed that radionuclide angiocardiography can be considered to be a reliable method today. No consensus was found for measurements of regional LV function or wall motion mainly because of differences in methodology used. These normal values may serve as general guidelines for future applications of these techniques but factors which may influence the normal range as defined and discussed in this study should be recognized.}",
